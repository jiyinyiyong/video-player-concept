# a Minimal Video Player Concept Design

### A simple video player

The control panels on Youtube and Tudou bothers.  
I'm trying to build a really concret and smart UI as a test.  
The demo was debugged on Chrome with HTML5 `<video>` tag.  
Hopefully someone likes it.  

Found it on my `gh-pages`:
